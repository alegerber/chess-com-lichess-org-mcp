# chess-com-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides access to the [Chess.com Published-Data API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) and the [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api). This gives LLMs the ability to look up player profiles, game history, stats, clubs, tournaments, puzzles, leaderboards, and more from both platforms.

## Usage examples

Once configured, you can ask your LLM things like:

**Chess.com:**
- "What is Hikaru's Chess.com rating?"
- "Show me Magnus Carlsen's recent blitz games on Chess.com"
- "Who are the top players on the Chess.com leaderboard?"
- "Get today's Chess.com daily puzzle"
- "List all Grandmasters on Chess.com"

**Lichess:**
- "Show me DrNykterstein's Lichess profile"
- "What's the head-to-head record between DrNykterstein and Firouzja2003 on Lichess?"
- "Get the Lichess daily puzzle"
- "Who are the top bullet players on Lichess?"
- "What games are currently featured on Lichess TV?"
- "Get the cloud evaluation for this position: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1"

**Cross-platform:**
- "Compare Hikaru's ratings on Chess.com and Lichess"
- "Get today's daily puzzle from both Chess.com and Lichess"

## Notes

- Both APIs are read-only and free to use. No API keys are required.
- **Chess.com**: Rate limiting applies to parallel requests. Data may be cached for up to 12-24 hours.
- **Lichess**: Requests are serial (one at a time). A 429 response means you should wait ~1 minute. Game exports stream as NDJSON.
